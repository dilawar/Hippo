# torch-rnn
torch-rnn provides high-performance, reusable RNN and LSTM modules for torch7, and uses these modules for character-level
language modeling similar to [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). Compared to char-rnn, torch-rnn is up to **1.9x faster** and uses up to **7x less memory**.
