    After the booking is cancelled, a new booking request can be created
    by clicking on button with calendar icon. The user can also create a fresh
    booking request by visiting appropriate links related to `Public
    Talks/Seminars`.
    
# Manage venues

???+ optional-class "How do I block a venue?"
    In your admin page (i.e., ==_Home -> BookMyVenue Admin_==), you will find link
    ==__Block Venues__==. Click on it and you will be presented a form.

    Select multiple venues (press down _Ctrl_ key), select start and end dates
    and start and end times. Select a reason for blocking the venue and pick the
    type of event for which you are blocking this venue. In the example below,
    I've slected type `WORKSHOP` and very unhelpful message for reason.

    Note that venues will be blocked immediately. No need for approval. Any
    booking made on these venues will be cancelled for the blocking period. The
    booking party may get an email that their booking is cancelled by admin (not
    sure about it!).
